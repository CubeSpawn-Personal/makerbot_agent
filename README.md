As part of the Roadmap project between NCDMM, AMT, the MTConnect Institute, and MAYA Design, this Agent-Adapter for a Makerbot was created to examine the process of one possible type of MTConnect implementer. As a result of this effort, a prototype Makerbot Agent-Adapter was created.

This prototype was written in Python, specifically Python 2.7, and uses Makerbot's Python implementation of the s3g protocol over USB to interface with a Makerbot. This code was tested with a Makerbot Replicator 2 and exposes the following data items from it:

* Axes: X, Y, Z, A, B
* Toolhead:
    * Temperature
    * Toolhead Ready (Boolean)
    * Extruder Sensor
        * Extruder Ready (Boolean)
* Platform:
    * Temperature
    * Platform Ready (Boolean)
* Motherboard
    * Power Error (Boolean)
    * Wait For Button (Boolean)
    * Heat Shutdown (Boolean)
    * Preheat (Boolean)
    * Build Canceling (Boolean)

Some terse installation instructions are provided in "rough install instructions.txt".

Basic dependencies are:

* A version of Python (Python 2.7 was used).
* A version of PySerial that works with your version of Python.
* The s3g protocol (provided in this repo).

Application configuration:

* Located in the /Makebot Agent-Adapter/config.json.
* Configuration settings are:
    *  DeviceConfigurationFile: a reference to the XML file containing the device(s) to be monitored by this Agent-Adapter.
    *  ErrorReference: a reference to the file containing the XML error template.
    *  HTTPHost: the IP and Port on which the application should serve the device data.

DeviceConfigurationFile:

* The XML file that structures the device(s) to be monitored by this Agent-Adapter. The structure takes the form described by the MTConnect Standard (at least version 1.2).
